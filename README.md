- [x] [Part 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/18)

___ 
[ ] Checklist | Experiments/ DIY
- [ ] Write a functional test with XCTest
    - NOTE: Might need to reference textbooks
    - Info resources:
        - TBA

___
[x] Checklist | Part 3:
- [x] 1. [WeSplit: Wrap up](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/wesplit-wrap-up)
    - Challenges:
        - [x] 1. Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”
        - [x] 2. Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
        - [x] 3. Change the tip percentage picker to show a new screen rather than using a segmented control, and give it a wider range of options – everything from 0% to 100%. Tip: use the range 0..<101 for your range rather than a fixed array.
    - Bonus:
        - [x] 4. And if you found those easy, here’s a tough one for you: rather than having to type .currency(code: Locale.current.currencyCode ?? "USD") in two places, can you make a new property to store the currency formatter? You’ll need to give your property a specific return type in order to keep the rest of your code happy: FloatingPointFormatStyle<Double>.Currency.
